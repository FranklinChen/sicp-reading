SICP Reading Group Notes and Exercises
======================================

Code and Supply members are reading through
[The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
and working through the exercises. This repository is here to help
collaboration on exercises

Repository Structure
--------------------

There are two top level directories, `Notes` and `Exercises`. In order
to allow anyone to keep a record of their personal notes and
solutions, both of these top level directories are populated by
individual subdirectories. When submitting your code to this
repository for the first time, make sure to create your own directory,
in either `Notes`, `Exercises`, or both. It should look something like
this:

```
sicp-reading
  |-- Notes
  |   |-- Person1
  |   `-- Person2
  |-- Exercises
  |   |-- Person1
  |   |-- Person2
  |   `-- Person3
```

Within your own directory, feel free to organize solutions and notes
however you'd like, but try to make it comprehensible.

Submitting Code
---------------

If you'd like to have comments on a set of exercises or modifications,
feel free to make a pull request to your directory. If you'd simply
like to push up some answers, ask for commit access.

Feel free to fork and branch locally however you like. This main
repository will only maintain a `master` branch though.
